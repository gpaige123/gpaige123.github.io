This week, I attended Black Tech Week in Cincinnati, which provided valuable industry insights relevant to my research. 
The event was an excellent opportunity to learn about current initiatives in the educational space for underrepresented demographics.

One highlight was the “Learning to Code” presentation by Stephanie Muhammad. 
The presentation covered the journey and benefits of learning to code, offering practical advice and inspiration. 
This session was highly beneficial to my research, as it emphasized effective strategies and tools that can be leveraged to engage 8th graders in computer science.

Overall, the event enriched my understanding of how to make computer science education more attractive and accessible to my target demographics.
