This week, I focused on creating a simple video series that could be shared on platforms
like TikTok or Instagram to engage 8th graders in learning computer science. I decided to
create five one-minute videos, each focusing on different aspects:

1. Python Programming - An introduction to the basics of Python.


2. Python Careers - Exploring various career paths that use Python.


3. Example of How a Python Video Can Be Created - Demonstrating the process of creating engaging content using Python.


4. AI Helping the World - Highlighting how AI, powered by Python, is making a positive impact globally.


5. Free Resources for Learning Python - Sharing valuable resources for beginners to learn Python for free.


I recorded myself for these videos and wrote detailed scripts to 
ensure they were concise and engaging. It took a lot of constant editing to refine these videos to the quality I envisioned, but the effort was worth it.
Each video now aligns perfectly with my goal of making computer science more accessible and appealing to younger audiences.
