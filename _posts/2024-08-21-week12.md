This week marks the conclusion of my research journey as I finalized my technical report.
Completing this paper has been incredibly rewarding, providing a sense of accomplishment in seeing all my hard work come together. 



I hope that my research and findings contribute to future opportunities for promoting computer science education, particularly among underrepresented demographics. 
This project has not only deepened my understanding of CS education but also reinforced my commitment to making these educational opportunities more accessible to all.

Looking forward, I am excited about the potential impact of this work and how it might inspire others to explore and develop innovative strategies in computer science education.
