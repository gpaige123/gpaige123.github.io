title: "Week 11"

This week, I took some time to go over the quality of my videos one more time, ensuring
that each one aligns with the objectives I set out at the beginning of this project. I wanted to 
make sure that the videos were not only engaging but also effectively conveyed the key 
messages about Python programming, careers in Python, and the broader impact of AI and technology.

In addition to the final review of my videos, I began constructing my final report technical 
paper. This is a crucial step where I aim to focus on telling a cohesive and compelling story,
showcasing what I have been building towards since the inception of my project. My goal is 
to clearly articulate the journey, the challenges, and the strategies I’ve developed to make 
computer science education more accessible and attractive to underrepresented demographics, particularly 8th graders.

This paper is more than just a summary—it’s a narrative that ties together all the elements 
of my research and practical efforts to create meaningful change in how computer science is perceived and taught.
