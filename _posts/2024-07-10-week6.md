This week, I focused on gaining insights into teaching computer science to both urban and rural areas. 
I watched several video presentations that discussed effective methods and strategies for making computer science education appealing and accessible to diverse demographics. 
These presentations provided valuable perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in different educational settings.

In addition to this, I conducted research on the current data regarding salaries in the computer science workforce.
It was fascinating to discover the range of job roles available in the field and how the compensation varies across different positions. 
Understanding these details is crucial for highlighting the potential financial benefits of pursuing a career in computer science to the 8th graders in my target demographics.

Furthermore, I explored the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on traditional low-level jobs, such as those in transportation and restaurants. 
The research revealed significant disruptions in these sectors due to AI automation. However, I also found promising data on the creation of new job opportunities brought about by advancements in AI technology.
This dual impact of AI underscores the importance of equipping students with computer science skills to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market.

By combining these insights, I am developing a comprehensive understanding of the computer science landscape, which will be instrumental in crafting effective visualizations and educational materials for my project.
These efforts align with my goal of making computer science careers more attractive to underrepresented communities.
