## About Me

My name is Geremy Paige. I am a graduate student at the Colorado School of Mines, studying Computer Science in the Bridge @Mines program. I come from a background in Business Administration and hold an MBA. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I switched my focus to computer science after recognizing the vast opportunities in technology, particularly through remote work and the innovation that technology brings.

I hope to utilize my knowledge in the computer science field to help underrepresented demographics learn about the benefits of computer science and continue contributing to overall innovation in the space.

**Graduation**: Expected May 2025

## About My Project

This research project aims to explore methods to make computer science careers more attractive to 8th graders in underrepresented demographics. The project will investigate the impact of socioeconomic status on access to computer science education and the effectiveness of different teaching resources, focusing on both rural and urban areas.

We will look at various open-source teaching resources, including YouTube, FreeCodeCamp, and more, with Python being the underlying programming language to help them learn.
