## About My Project
This research project aims to explore methods to make computer science careers more attractive to 8th graders in underrepresented demographics. The project will investigate the impact of socioeconomic status on access to computer science education and the effectiveness of different teaching resources, focusing on both rural and urban areas.

We will look at various open-source teaching resources, including YouTube, FreeCodeCamp, and more, with Python being the underlying programming language to help them learn.
