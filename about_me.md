## About Me

My name is Geremy Paige. I am a graduate student at the Colorado School of Mines, studying Computer Science in the Bridge @Mines program. I come from a background in Business Administration and hold an MBA. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I switched my focus to computer science after recognizing the vast opportunities in technology, particularly through remote work and the innovation that technology brings.

I hope to utilize my knowledge in the computer science field to help underrepresented demographics learn about the benefits of computer science and continue contributing to overall innovation in the space.

**Graduation**: Expected May 2025  
**Email**: gpaige@mines.edu
